<p>The Orient in general, has some common features. They share same animals that have dominated roles in their lives. One of them is mouse. Every where in the world, mice are considered pest to people, yet actually, it plays well its natural role as an animal in the food ring. To the land where agriculture plays the greatest role, mice are not only a kind of animal but a cultural sign. That’s why it stands at the first position of 12 zodiac signs.</p>
<p>Respected for its smartness and quick-witted, people with rat sign is imaginative and generous, especially with people on their same boat. You are working a “rat person”? Then do not spend a moment underestimating him or her. Maybe they appear with a dove-y look, yet inside they are calculating carefully every single step to win and conquer the rival to achieve their goal.</p>

<p>This is one of the most different features between China and Vietnam zodiac culture. For Chinese, ox is considered extremely important in their agriculture life. Moreover, Chinese climate is more suitable for ox to fully function their ability. For Vietnamese, a buffalo is the greatest asset of a commoner, and even for a village mayor, his buffalo herd is the most important property to protect.</p>
<p>In ancient Vietnamese, the word Happiness contains in its many elements involving rice plant and rice field. For a small farming economy Vietnam possesses, it is easy to understand why buffalo is placed at the position of a cultural symbol. It does not only bring about rice but secure feeling for Vietnamese.The “buffalo person” is supposed to be a firm characteristic with born leadership. However, a buffalo life way is rarely smooth but rather rough before achieving success at the end of a journey. If your buffalo partner seems too serious, do not worry since it is just the outer of an extremely warm heart that can be fully opened by a passionate lover.</p>

<p>Tiger is definitely a holy animal of Vietnam, where it is considered the king of forest. Mentioning Vietnam's territory with ¾ areas being mountain and forest, one can easily understand why the image of tiger is even integrated into pagoda's and temple's architecture in Vietnam, and thus becomes one of the holy deities of Vietnam belief.</p>
<p>Person with tiger sign is brave, smart and risky. He or she is expected to do unusual, and extraordinary, things and become extremely successful in life. However, as the strong one is often a black sheep one, some tigers confront many challenges from social bias, living very troubled lives. Tiger girls in Vietnam often have trouble in marriage since their personality is too strong, yet as mothers they consider children breeding the most serious thing in life. The way they protect and bring up their children is sometimes just overwhelming.</p>

<p>It is the same from the East to the West for dog and cat to be popular domestic pets. These two animals are loved by people all around the world (except those with an allergy), yet cat in Vietnam seems to be raised more widespread than dog. The very first reason for this difference is that cat is extremely useful for keeping rice from pests. Gradually, cat becomes more and more familiar with Vietnamese, sharing with them wealth and poverty, sorrow and happiness.

    Cat person reflects the typical characteristics of cat, who is supposed to be tender but secretive. Cat person is courteous and sociable, yet always they keep for themselves a secret that makes them attractive. It is hard to tell whether cat people can be happy or unhappy in life since fate depends on many things else, yet definitely cat person is a mind of great depth.</p>

<p>Wang Xu, the ancient famous scholar of China had said “Flooring a dragon? It’s impossible!”. Common knowledge of both Chinese and Vietnamese shows that dragon is an surreal animal, yet according to an ancient document of minor group Mường (Northwest of Vietnam) initially, dragon is a real animal which lived under the water and ate carrion. Dragon later was deified and becomes the most sacred among holy animals recognized by Oriental people.</p>
<p>Dragon people therefore are supposed to be born talented however arrogant and tactless. As placed at the position of king, their image are associated with at royal places such as palace and on king’s robe. It is said that dragon person never live poorly but would be wealthy or at least well-to-do. However, Wang Xu also said if a dragon one can balance between big things and small affairs, their life would be perfect.</p>

<p>Vietnam wet climate is definitely a prime land for snake to live. The interaction between snake and human and snake use for medicine have put snake in the important place of an animal that symbolizes a great part of Vietnam culture. While snake always appears dangerously, its venom and skin are very useful in medicine. Don’t you be surprised to see a snake person so lucky! That’s one of the most prominent features of snake sign. On the other hand, a snake one is extremely charming: once you are caught in love with a snake girl, you can hardly escape the relationship.</p>

<p>Horse plays a prime role in transportation in Vietnamese society in the past. As road in this country did not well develop, horse is thee almost only choice for transportation, both in daily life and in army. With a country having ¾ mountainous and forestry area, horse is respected for its usefulness. It helps people trek across forest, climb up mountain and especially did very well its passenger role at the time mailing was limited by low-tech transportation.</p>
